🔐 Defend-it-with-Damary

Welcome! This repository documents my hands-on journey into the world of cybersecurity as I work toward completing my MSc in Information Systems Security.

As I develop technical and strategic skills in areas like SOC operations, cyber risk management, and network defense, I’ll be sharing write-ups, walkthroughs, and mini-projects here to showcase my learning and growth.

🧭 Goals

📚 Complete foundational and intermediate labs on TryHackMe and similar platforms

🧪 Build and document a home cybersecurity lab (including tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Splunk, etc.)

🔐 Explore GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) concepts and frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)

📄 Create short write-ups that reflect real-world scenarios and skill application

🤝 Connect with professionals and demonstrate readiness for cybersecurity roles
